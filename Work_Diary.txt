This document serves as an additonal resource to use alongside with GIT commit history,
serving more of a general managing role over the entire working process (present and future).
I will store here my general work flow for later analysis.

Stage 1: Design
(09/01/2022)    Detailed explanation in the "Design Notes.txt", but overall I'm trying to improve my
	       design ahead of time and bring it to as good of a condition as possible in the core,
	       while leaving some open direction in the more high-level parts like UI or specific
	       factories/data implementations.
