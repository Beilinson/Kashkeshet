This document serves as an additonal resource to use alongside with GIT commit history,
serving more of a general managing role over the entire working process (present and future).
I will store here my general work flow for later analysis.

	Detailed explanation in the "Design Notes.txt", but overall I'm trying to improve my

	while leaving some open direction in the more high-level parts like UI or specific
	factories/data implementations.
